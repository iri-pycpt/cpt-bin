  summary: 'The Climate Predictability Tool'
  description: |
    The Climate Predictability Tool (CPT) is a software package for
    constructing a seasonal climate forecast model, performing model
    validation, and producing forecasts given updated data. Its design
    has been tailored for producing seasonal climate forecasts using
    model output statistic (MOS) corrections to climate predictions
    from general circulation model (GCM), or for producing forecasts
    using fields of sea-surface temperatures or similar
    predictors. Although the software is specifically tailored for
    these applications, it can be used in more general settings to
    perform canonical correlation analysis (CCA), principal components
    regression (PCR), or multiple linear regression (MLR) on any data,
    and for any application.
